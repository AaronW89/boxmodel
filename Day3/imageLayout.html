        <h2>Red Eyed Tree Frog</h2>
        <img src="frog_480.jpg" class="imgSize" id="imgLay1">
        <p>As its name suggests, the red-eyed tree frog has red eyes with vertically narrowed pupils. It has a vibrant green body with yellow and blue, vertically striped sides. Its webbed feet and toes are orange or red. The skin on the red-eyed tree frog's belly is soft and fragile, whereas the back is thicker and rougher. Red-eyed tree frogs have sticky pads on their toes. Phyllomedusine tree frogs are arboreal, meaning they spend a majority of their lives in trees; they are excellent jumpers. Red-eyed tree frogs are not poisonous and rely on camouflage to protect themselves. During the day, they remain motionless, cover their blue sides with their back legs, tuck their bright feet under their bellies, and shut their red eyes. Thus, they appear almost completely green, and well hidden among the foliage.[5] The large red eyes not only allow identification, but also serve as a defensive adaptation through deimatic behaviour. When a red-eyed tree frog detects an approaching predator, it abruptly opens its eyes and stares at the predator. The sudden appearance of the red eyes may startle the predator, giving the frog a chance to flee.</p>

        <h2>Owls</h2>
        <img src="owl_480.jpg" class="imgSize" id="imgLay2">
        <p>Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes, which includes about 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl.

Owls hunt mostly small mammals, insects, and other birds, although a few species specialize in hunting fish. They are found in all regions of the Earth except Antarctica and some remote islands.

Owls are divided into two families: the Strigidae family of true (or typical) owls; and the Tytonidae family of barn-owls.</p>
